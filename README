These are just some customized supybot modules that are in use for a supybot
instance on a private irc server.

The code is UGLY, but functional.   Keep in mind, it's been written by several
different people at different times as a hack to get plugins working in
a private IRC channel.

Patches gleefully accepted.  :)

Most of these custom modules use ~/.boombot.cfg for module specific
configuration.  In particular, Goog and UrlLog are known to read critical
values there.  Others may also.

This README isn't guaranteed to be up to date.

Someday, these may be moved into the supybot config file, but they work
quite well this way.
